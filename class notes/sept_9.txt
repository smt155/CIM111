Semantic elements
  - section is the same thing as div
  next assignment: updating resume to CSS
  - articles are not useful for resume
  - footer, section, header

CSS
- cascading style sheet
- how to add style


<style>  p {color: red;} </style>
  - if put in a heading then its going to change just that ONE heading
  - if you put it in h2{} then its going to change all the h2s in that page (only one page)
  - best way: separate file as html, use html link tag to send you to css page; creating .css file and linking
  it in the html
      HOW TO DO THIS:  in resume folder create new file for css
  - selector{}: html tag --> if you don't select it you cant change it; put all rules for that selection
        {color: red;}

ID
- only in opening tag
- very specific
- ex id="this_paragraph" for picking one thing on the page
- # in front in css

class
  ex: class="some_paragraph"
  can be used in all of them
  general grouping
  space in class means two different names
    "some_paragraph dominguez"
      - name= some_paragraph and dominguez
   . in front in css


every tag in html has to have an open and a close



Grids 10/2
-  help break down into component
- creates structure
- grid-gap (css)
    - decide how much space you want uniformly
- container : bounding box
- grid items : grid lines(colums and rows) cells and areas
- parent - display property
    - grid container
- every grid needs its own container
