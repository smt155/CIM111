        <h2 id="a_"> Vibez by DaBaby </h2>
        <p id=a_1>
            DaBaby is an upcoming artist during 2019. His single Suge took over
            every platform and now he strikes again with a brand new album Kirk.
            Kirk really describes DaBabys sound, especially the song Vibez.
            Not only is Vibez mny favorite song on the album but it is also his.
            His beats and lyrics are unmatched. He has a different sound than most rappers
            which is what makes him so different.
        </p>



        <h2 id="b_">The Motto by Drake</h2>
            <p id="b_1">
                DRAKE. Who doesn't like Drake? The Motto by Drake is a CLASSIC. I remember hearing this song
                when I was around 11/12 years old, and it still continues to play today.
                It is an extremelt catchy song. When this song comes on in a social setting
                you know everyone is about to start singing the lyrics and it becomes a contest who knows
                them best. The album Take Care has many many tracks that are classics in the present day.
            </p>



        <h2 id="c_">Feel No Ways by Drake</h2>
        <p id="c_1">
            Again Drake, an ICON, and nothing less. This album takes me back to summer 2016. The summer before my senior
            year of highschool. One of the most memorable summers in my life. I chose this song because I still listen
            to this track on a daily. Drake's music just matches your mood and he has a song for every mood possible.
            He is extremely versitile, and that is one of the reasons as to why he is one of the greatest in my books.
        </p>



        <h2 id="d_"> Blood On The Money by Future</h2>
            <p id="d_1">
                DS2 was one of the first albums that got me into rap music.
                Future is one of my all time favorite rappers and this album was and still is amazing.
                Blood on the money was one of the first rap songs I learned all the lyrics to,
                the beats and the way he put the song together is unmatched.
            </p>

        <h2 id="e_"> Sweatpants by Childish Gambino</h2>
        <p id="e_1">
            Gambino was an artist I discovered at a very young age. I was infatuated by his
            flow and ability rhyme. His songs are a different kind of rap I would say. His music has originality
            and very few artists sound like him. I chose the song sweatpants because it was one of the first songs
            I knew all the lyrics too. The lyrics are funny, catchy, and all around very different than most.
            It's a very fun song.
        </p>



        <h2 id="f_"> Senior Skip Day by Mac Miller</h2>
        <p id="f_1">
            Mac Miller has an extremely special place in my heart. I listened to his music at a very young age
            and loved the sound and the persona he had. He wasn't a show off and liked to live a very
            simple life, and he expressed that through his music. Old Mac Miller is something I will forever listen to,
            especially this song. I love the music video, the lyrics, the beat. EVERYTHING. He has impacted me in a ways an
            artist never has.
        </p>



        <h2 id="g_"> No Type by Rae Sremmurd</h2>
        <p id="g_1">
            Rae Sremmurd really appeared out of no where. Fun fact: the name backwards is Drummers Ear.
            I thought that was extremely creative. They dropped this album and their career sky roketed like
            something I have never seen before. I remember going on a trip to New York and listening to this album
            for the first time. It was one of the first rap albums I ever listened to. This song specifically stood out to me.
            The beat was so catchy I learned the lyrics after listening to it once.
        </p>



        <h2 id="h_"> The Morning by The Weeknd</h2>
        <p id="h_1">
            I have never been much of a fan girl but the Weeknd changed that. I am absolutely OBSSESED with his music.
            This album specifically. I learned about the Weeknd in 2013/2014 I believe. I heard a remix of his song
            Often and did not stop replaying it. After that I looked for more of his music and fell in love with Trilogy.
            I listen to this album fully at least once a month I would say, and I listen to this song at least once a week.
            I wouldn't classify the album as "rap" but in a sense it is. His sound is just very different and his voice
            is so soothing, and I had never heard anything like it before.
        </p>



        <h2 id="i_"> Mannequin Challenge by Young Thug ft Juice WRLD </h2>
        <p id="i_1">
            Young Thug dropped an album recently and it was amazing. I have always been a fan of Young Thug. I would listen to his music
            a lot in highschool on my way from and back to school. This song is my favorite on the album because
            Juice WRLD and Young Thug produce such an amazing sound together it is unlike anything I have ever heard.

    <footer class="ending">
        Music has always been important to me,from a young age I remember sitting on youtube and just spending hours searching for
        different sounds. I started off loving hardcore edm, transitioned to pop, then indie, and back to edm, and then rap. Rap has been
        the most prominent genre in my life since I can remember.
