        <p class="intro1">The South of France blows me away every time. My family and I have been going to
          Beaulieu-sur-Mer for the last five to seven years. It is the perfect combination of the Mediterranean sea
          plus beautiful tall mountains, the view NEVER dissapoints. We enjoy staying there for months at a times, enjoying
          the town of Nice, the country of Monaco, and being able to reach Saint Tropez by boat is a dream come true.
          The South of France has a very special place in my heart and I will forever cherish its physical beauty as well as
          the memories I have..</p>
