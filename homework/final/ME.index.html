        <p class="intro1">One of the most historical lands in the world, Israel tells the story of all the religions
          throughout the beautiful city of Jerusalem. Israel was extremely impactful because it was the opposite
          of what was portrayed in the media. It was more than astonishing, enriching, and really calm. From going to the
          infamous dead sea, seeing waterfalls in the middle of the dessert, riding camels, and enjoying some amazing outdoor
          nightlift, Israel really brings a taste of its own and has the ability to shock outsiders.</p>
