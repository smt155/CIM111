        <p class="intro1">I have been to Florence multiple times now, I would say maybe 4 to 5 times. Everytime I go the small
          town encapsulates me. The duomo in the middle of the town makes for a stunning landmark but also a beautiful view
          for people who live in Florence year round. The safetyness of the streets is attractive as well as the smallness of the
          town. There are many historical and beautiful art pieces that have to be seen when in Florence. The statue of David, Ponte Vechio, and much more.
