        <h2 class="fancy_title">By: Sheila Taratuta</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          A private town within a town. Golden Beach is home to some of the most luxurious homes in South Florida.
          During the 1920's two brothers bought the property now known as Golden Beach and found investors. On May 23rd, 1929, Golden Beach
          was established as a Town. The town was created with a vision to create a tight knit community along the beautiful ocean and
          intercoastal of Miami. As the years went by, and different architectrual styles arouse, the community began to expand and
          build beautiful luxurious homes.</p>

          <p id="home1-para" class="info1">
            The perfect way to create an inside/outside illusion.
            The side sliding door
            allows guests to walk directly into the most
            prized area of the house: The indoor barbeque.</p>

        <section id="home3">
          <img id="home3-pic" src="images/home3.png" alt="backyard" height="350" width="350">
          <p id="home3-para" class="info3">The back of the house faces the intercoastal waters. The
            tall beautiful sliding glass doors looks absolutely stuning from the water.
            The matching wood floors of the inside to the outside of the house creates an amazing backyard.
            The back of the house demonstrates the most modern style possible.
          </p>

        <section id="home2">
          <img id="home2-pic" src="images/home2.png" alt="main entrance" height="350" width="350">
          <p id="home2-para" class="info2">Here we finally see the main entrance of the house. Although
            it doesn't look like it, the door is a huge wooden slab that is extremely heavy.
            Usually people that are regulars at my home use the door directed into the BBQ. But when there is
            multiple guests we try using the marvelous front door. </p>

        <section id="home4">
          <img id="home4-pic" src="images/home4.png" alt="four" height="350" width="350">
          <p id="home4-para" class="info4">The front of the house. The most architecturally modern home
            on the island. The water surrounding the house gives it the feeling that the house is "floating."
            The combination of the concrete and the wood show a very different style of modern and rustic. The glass
            at the front of the house and the back of the house, allows the sunshine to come in through the back windows and
            into the front of the home. Giving guests a view of the backyard and a sight into the inside of the house.</p>

        <section id="home5">
          <img id="home5-pic" src="images/home5.png" alt="five" height="350" width="350">
          <p id="home5-para" class="info5">Originally, the stairs of the
            house were supposed to be dark brown. After long contemplation we decided to leave them natural.
            The stairs still needed to be painted and sanded but now there are beautiful natural wooden stairs. For some decorations
            the stairs underneath has a pool of grey rocks and a beautiful long chandelier over it. This helps
            stick to the inside/outside idea of the house. These same rocks continue to the outside and you can see them
            through the low windows underneath the stairs.

        <section id="home6">
          <img id="home6-pic" src="images/home6.png" alt="six" height="350" width="350">
          <p id="home6-para" class="info6">In this photo we get to see the indoor barbeque that
            has been mentioned multiple times. As said before, this is the most used spaced in the house.
            This space was insipred by the indoor barbeque in a rustic Uruguayan home we have been renting
            for the past 10 years. In Uruguay this is also the most used space in the house. My mom tried
            to recreate the same feeling but in a modern way. </p>

        <section id="home7">
          <img id="home7-pic" src="images/home7.png" alt="seven" height="350" width="350">
          <p id="home7-para" class="info7">Very similar to the second photo, but this one was taken at a darker time.
            As the sun begins to set and all the lights in the house are turned on you are able to see directly into the home.
            This shows the cholor schemes are similar on the inside and the outside. It also exposes the brightness
            of the home and the modern set up. </p>
        </section>

        <section id="home8">
          <img id="home8-pic" src="images/home8.png" alt="eight" height="350" width="350">
          <p id="home8-para" class="info8">This photo demonstrates the simplicity and uniqueness of the home.
            This living room is set right behind the "fancy" dinner table. When guests come over the living room, the dinner table,
            and the backyard become one. Creating a huge space which allows for more guests.</p>

        <section id="home9">
          <img id="home9-pic" src="images/home9.png" alt="nine" height="350" width="350">
          <p id="home9-para" class="info9">I included this photo of the main entrance so the size and material of the front
            door could be appreciated. The other photos do not do the front door justice. This is a huge slab of wood with fine detail</p>
