      <section: about_me>
<p>I was born in <b>Miami FL</b> on June 7th 1999. At the age of three,
I moved to <b>Sao Paolo, Brazil</b>. At five, I moved back to Miami.
Througout my childhood I focused on swim competions and playing the piano.
After graduating from middle school my family and I decided to move to <b>Buenos Aires,
Argentina</b>. I completed my first two years of highschool at an American International School.
At 15, I moved back to Miami and continued my highschool career at Nova Southeastern University,
where I graduated from. After being accepted into the University of Miami in the spring of 2018.
I decided to go abroad my first semester. I lived in Rome, Italy for about four months.
Once I started college at the U, I became a member of Alpha Delta Pi and became the Co-Founder
of URecovery. Currently, I am majoring in Psychology and minoring in criminology.</p>
